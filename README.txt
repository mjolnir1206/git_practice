Hello Git and GitHub

I really thought I was doing well, you know?  I asked for feedback constantly and was told, "You're doing great!  Just keep doing what you're doing!".  I felt like I was on the right path. I felt like I belonged.  I felt like I was where I was meant to be and doing what I was menat to be doing.

I was wrong.
